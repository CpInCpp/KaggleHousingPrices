split off 25% of the data set for testing.
cross validation (K fold)


maybe I could use a correlation matrix to find the most correlated features, and then use them for feature engineering.
Then, I can start feature selection.

try different loss functions.
understand the metric for effective modeling.


feature selection

issue of multicollinearity
######
run a simple linear regression of all combinations features (minus the target variable),
and look at the rsquares as a measure of collinearity.

get correlation matrix and choose features based on absolute value of correlation
